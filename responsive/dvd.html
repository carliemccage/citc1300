                    <p>When DVDs came out in the late '90s, they were a massive upgrade — better picture quality, no rewinding, bonus features, and they didn’t degrade over time like tapes. DVDs were also cheaper to produce and distribute.</p>

                    <img src="images/dvd2.jpg" alt="DVD photo 2">
                    <p>Once the internet got fast enough, people began downloading or streaming movies. Services like Netflix (originally a DVD-by-mail service) began to shift toward streaming, making physical media less relevant.</p>

                <div class="col"><h3>Convenience & Quality</h3>
            <img src="images/dvd3.jpg" alt="DVD photo 3">
            <p>VHS tapes were bulky, prone to wear and tear, and required VCRs (which were mechanical and finicky). DVDs and then streaming offered instant access, better resolution, and less hassle.</p>
