            <h2>The History of VHS</h2>
            <p>VHS was developed by the Japanese company JVC in 1976 and became the standard for video recording in the 1980s. The format was a breakthrough because it allowed users to record television broadcasts and watch movies at home. VHS cassettes were affordable, and the VCR (Video Cassette Recorder) became a must-have household appliance. By the mid-1980s, rental stores like Blockbuster were popping up everywhere, offering an expansive library of VHS tapes.</p>
