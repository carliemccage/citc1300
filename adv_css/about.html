             <h1>The Decline of VHS</h1>
             <p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, VHS faced strong competition from DVDs, which offered higher quality video and sound, as well as additional features like menus and special content. The convenience of digital media, with the advent of streaming services and downloads, eventually made VHS obsolete. By the mid-2000s, production of VHS tapes had virtually stopped, and video rental chains began shutting down.</p>


            <h2>The VHS Revival and Collecting</h2>
            <p>Despite its decline, VHS has seen a nostalgic resurgence in the 2020s. Collectors value VHS tapes for their retro charm, unique box art, and the grainy aesthetic that cannot be replicated on digital formats. Rare tapes, especially those from obscure genres or limited releases, have become prized possessions among collectors. Some people even seek out VHS for the "grainy" feel that digital formats just can’t match.</p>

            <h3>How to Start Collecting VHS</h3>
            <ul>
                 <li>Look for classic horror, cult films, or rare releases.</li>
                <li>Check the condition of the tape and box—pristine boxes with original inserts are especially valuable.</li>
                <li>Be mindful of the quality of the tape—look out for any visible damage to the cassette or the tape itself.</li>
                <li>Don’t forget to enjoy the experience! Watching a VHS tape is a trip down memory lane, and the unique qualities of the format make for a fun, nostalgic experience.</li>
            </ul>
